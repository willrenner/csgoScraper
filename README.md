### csgoScraper

My CSGO stat scraper allows you to upload an html file (obtained from Steam)
and scrape the file for important Counter-Strike: Global Offensive stats. The html file can
obtained from steam's website under: Steam -> Games -> Personal Game Data (under CSGO) -> Competitive Matches. You must
manualy load your match history by continuously clicking "Load More History". You can
optionally download "Ban Checker for Steam" from the chrome store to have your whole match history
automatically loaded. Once all matches have been loaded, right click the page and save it as a .txt or .html file. Now, you can upload this file to
my CSGO stat scraper to view your stats. Note that steam has deleted all data before
2017 to reclaim storage space. My CSGO stat scraper is made with HTML/CSS and javascript (jQuery, chart.js).
